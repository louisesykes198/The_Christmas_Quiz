such as Playfair Display or sans-serif, which makes them stand out on the page. The button language is straightforward and clear, so it's readable and complements the modern design.  
The text colours are largely black and white to contrast with the red background, with some tweaks to match the green and gold button styles.
All fonts were sourced through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

The headlines' bold, Playfair Display font draws attention without being unduly harsh, and nicely balanced.

4. The buttons are evenly placed for clarity, with a bright green colour and a gold hover effect to emphasise interactivity.
   Responsive Design: The layout adapts to various screen sizes, making the quiz accessible on desktop, mobile and iPad devices.

This layout is striking with a mix of utility and the festive theme, making the quiz visually appealing and easy to browse.

Animated snowflakes gently fall across the screen, giving movement and a wintery atmosphere. The snowflakes are delicate and not distracting, 
creating a dynamic background without overpowering the content.
The bright red background shows warmth and festivity, making it the ideal canvas for the interactive features and adding to the festive mood.
Green buttons with a gold hover effect offer contrast while also creating a sense of interactivity, directing the user's attention to the quiz answers.
