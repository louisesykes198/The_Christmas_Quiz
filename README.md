## Testing

For this project, I will manually test the quiz application's functionality, usability, and design. Manual testing allows me to interact with the quiz as a user, verifying that all features, such as question navigation, scoring, and reset features, function correctly while also identifying any potential user experience concerns or problems that automated testing may miss.

To test the quiz, I opened the quiz in a browser such as Chrome or Microsoft Edge. I checked the first question and answer boxes displayed on the screen correctly.
When clicking the answer, I checked that the score starts at 0 and if the answer was correct the score, then changed to 1.
Once I got to the end of the quiz I made sure the information on the quiz complete page looked good and the play again button took you back to the start of the quiz.

The quiz is responsive on different device sizes

### What is Testing

#### Automated Testing

Automated testing uses pre-scripted test cases and tools to automatically validate software operation, making it ideal for repeated, large-scale activities like regression, load, and performance testing. It provides speed, accuracy, and efficiency, especially for tests that need to run repeatedly or across multiple versions of an application. However, it involves an initial investment in scripts and tools, making it ideal for long-term use in projects that are constantly changing.

#### Manual Testing

Manual testing, on the other hand, necessitates the execution of test cases by human testers and is therefore ideal for exploratory testing, usability assessment, and user experience review. It can adapt, allowing testers to identify unexpected errors and assess UI/UX components, but it is slower and more prone to human error. Manual testing works well for one-time tests, short projects, or situations requiring a high level of human assessment, and it supplements automated testing by covering areas that automation may overlook.

## Validator

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
